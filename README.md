This project shows the use of HTML, CSS, and JS in a simple website. There is an image of a "taco", which will rotate when clicking it. There is a color scheme within the CSS, and although not the prettiest, all items in the color scheme are used in the webpage. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: 
    * Added rules for links
        * Removed underline from them (I think it makes it look weird)
        * Added hover effect to bold the links
    * Added rules for footer paragraph tags
        * Removed padding
    * Moved everything over from the side using margin-left
    * Learned a new CSS selector (~) that, for a ~ b, will get every b that is immediately after a
        * Used this to remove margin-top from ul's that come after h4's
    * Added color scheme
        * Used CSS variables to unify color scheme
        * Changed text color
        * Changed background color of page
        * Changed link colors
        * While it looks very bad, the requirement on the rubric says to use *all* the colors in the palette.
- **HTML semantic tags**:
    * Added links
        * Two links, one to WPI, the other to Montgomery College
    * Added a footer
    * Added a main
    * Added an image
        * A photo of a hotdog
    * Added a time tag

- **Added JS animation**:
    * Click on the "taco" (the hotdog) to rotate it
        * I had not done JS animations before, but after learning that it is simply updating the styles of an element, it became much less daunting

## Design Achievements
- **Creted colorscheme**
    * See repo for photo of color palette
- **Used Font from Google Fonts**
    * I used Poppins as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
